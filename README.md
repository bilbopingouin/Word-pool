## Objective

For a parent trying to help their kid to read and learn, one typically learn the letters one after the others. In order to practice reading and writing, one needs a list of words using only the already known letters. And usually not too large.

This project offers such an option.

## Install

You need a `python3` installation, and possibly (at least I needed to) add the optional packages `scipy` and `enchant` with the needed dictionary.

## Usage

Either use all the defaults as

``` bash
python3 anagram.py
```

Or check the built-in help as

``` bash
python3 anagram.py --help
```
